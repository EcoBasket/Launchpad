## Introduction

We won Launchpad 5.0! :rocket:

Launchpad is a 24-hour hackathon organized by Bath Entrepreneurs, where cross-disciplinary teams compete to conceive and launch a business based on a given prompt. This years’ prompt was “Make a better future for humanity”.

The development team consisted of [Sergios](https://github.com/sg2295) and [Luke](https://github.com/lc2232) working on a React-Native frontend, [myself](https://github.com/OllieJonas) working on a backend written in Java Spring, hosted using tools from AWS, and [Alex](https://github.com/ll1) working on both frontend and backend.

We also had [Andy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-barton-000/) and [Lukas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lukas-moment/) working on a business plan and presenting the idea. We aim to provide a new way to promote sustainability and work toward a better future, through EcoBasket!

EcoBasket helps address the problem of food-related environmental pollution, by calculating a Carbon Emission Score for food items sold in supermarkets, as well as providing better alternatives, to promote environmentally conscious shopping decisions.
